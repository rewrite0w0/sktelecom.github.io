<br>Contribution."
<br>
<br>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
<br>whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
<br>within the Work.
<br>
<br>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
<br>License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
<br>non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
<br>reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
<br>sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
<br>form.
<br>
<br>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
<br>each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
<br>no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
<br>license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
<br>transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
<br>licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br>Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
<br>which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
<br>against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
<br>alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
<br>direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
<br>You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
<br>litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
<br>Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
<br>Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
<br>    this License; and
<br>
<br>  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
<br>    You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
<br>    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
<br>    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
<br>    any part of the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
<br>    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
<br>    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
<br>    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
<br>    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
<br>    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
<br>    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
<br>    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
<br>    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
<br>    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
<br>    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
<br>    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
<br>    cannot be construed as modifying the License.
<br>
<br>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
<br>additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
<br>distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
<br>provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
<br>with the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
<br>Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
<br>Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
<br>additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
<br>supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
<br>executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
<br>trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
<br>for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
<br>reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
<br>writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
<br>Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
<br>either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
<br>conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
<br>associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
<br>tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
<br>applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
<br>writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
<br>direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
<br>arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
<br>computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
<br>losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
<br>damages.
<br>
<br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
<br>Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
<br>acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
<br>rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
<br>may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
<br>any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
<br>Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
<br>such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
<br>liability.
<br>

<br>under the terms of that license agreement. By installing, copying, downloading,
<br>accessing, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the

<br>        supplemental software code provided to you as part of the Support
<br>        Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to
<br>        the terms and conditions of this EULA.

<br>        any upgrades, this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of
<br>        Authenticity). Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any
<br>        other indirect transfer. The transferee of such one-time transfer must
<br>        agree to comply with the terms of this EULA, including the obligation not
<br>        to further transfer this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
<br>
<br>      * Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, ACME may terminate
<br>        this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this

<br>
<br>  4. BACKUP COPY. After installation of one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pursuant
<br>    to this EULA, you may keep the original media on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>    was provided by ACME solely for backup or archival purposes. If the original
<br>    media is required to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on the COMPUTER, you may make
<br>    one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT solely for backup or archival purposes.
<br>    Except as expressly provided in this EULA, you may not otherwise make copies
<br>    of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE
<br>    PRODUCT.

<br>    252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), as applicable.
<br>
<br>  6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. This SOFTWARE PRODUCT has been classified by the US
<br>    Government as exportable under License Exception TSU. Therefore the following
<br>    terms apply: You agree that you will not export or re-export the SOFTWARE
<br>    PRODUCT, any part thereof, or any process or service that is the direct
<br>    product of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (the foregoing collectively referred to as
<br>    the Restricted Components), to any country, person or entity subject to U.S.
<br>    export restrictions. You specifically agree not to export or re-export any of
<br>    the Restricted Components (i) to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed
<br>    or restricted the export of goods or services, which currently include, but
<br>    are not necessarily limited to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
<br>    and Syria, or to any national of any such country, wherever located, who
<br>    intends to transmit or transport the Restricted Components back to such
<br>    country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or have reason to know
<br>    will utilize the Restricted Components in the design, development or
<br>    production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any person
<br>    or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export
<br>    transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. You warrant and
<br>    represent that neither the Bureau of Export Administration nor any other U.S.
<br>    federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges.
<br>
<br>
<br>MISCELLANEOUS
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>This EULA is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the
<br>United States of America.
<br>
<br>
<br>LIMITED WARRANTY
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>ACME warrants that (a) the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will perform substantially in
<br>accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90)
<br>days from the date of receipt, and (b) any Support Services provided by ACME
<br>shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to
<br>you by ACME, and ACME support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts
<br>to solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow
<br>limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not
<br>apply to you.
<br>
<br>
<br>CUSTOMER REMEDIES. ACMEs and its suppliersentire liability and your exclusive
<br>remedy shall be, at ACMEs option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or
<br>(b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet ACMEs
<br>Limited Warranty and which is returned to ACME with a copy of your receipt. This
<br>Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from
<br>accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be
<br>warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,
<br>whichever is longer.
<br>
<br>NO OTHER WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACME AND
<br>ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE
<br>SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES.
<br>THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH
<br>VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.
<br> 
<br>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no
<br>event shall ACME or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
<br>indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,
<br>damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
<br>information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability
<br>to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the provision of or failure to provide Support
<br>Services, even if ACME has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In
<br>any case, ACMEs entire liability under any provision of this EULA shall be
<br>limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE
<br>PRODUCT or U.S. $5.00; provided, however, if you have entered into a ACME Support
<br>Services Agreement, ACMEs entire liability regarding Support Services shall be
<br>governed by the terms of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions do
<br>not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not
<br>apply to you.

<br>
<br>License
<br>
<br>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
<br>PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
<br>OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
<br>LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
<br>
<br>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
<br>BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED
<br>TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
<br>CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
<br>
<br>1. Definitions
<br>
<br>  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
<br>    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
<br>    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
<br>    phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
<br>    other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including
<br>    in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
<br>    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
<br>    of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
<br>    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
<br>    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
<br>    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
<br>
<br>  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
<br>    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
<br>    other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
<br>    which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
<br>    constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
<br>    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
<br>    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
<br>    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
<br>    not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
<br>    License.
<br>
<br>  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
<br>    of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of
<br>    ownership.
<br>
<br>  d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
<br>    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
<br>
<br>  e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the

<br>    the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
<br>    persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
<br>    perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
<br>    case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first

<br>    broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
<br>
<br>  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
<br>    this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
<br>    scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
<br>    expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
<br>    writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
<br>    dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in
<br>    dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic
<br>    work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
<br>    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
<br>    engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
<br>    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an
<br>    illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
<br>    geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
<br>    phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
<br>    copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to
<br>    the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
<br>
<br>  g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
<br>    has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
<br>    Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
<br>    rights under this License despite a previous violation.
<br>
<br>  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
<br>    communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,
<br>    including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make
<br>    available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may
<br>    access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
<br>    to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the
<br>    communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by
<br>    public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
<br>    means including signs, sounds or images.
<br>
<br>  i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without

<br>    reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
<br>    performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
<br>
<br>2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or
<br>restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
<br>exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
<br>under copyright law or other applicable laws.
<br>
<br>3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
<br>hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
<br>duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
<br>as stated below:
<br>
<br>  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
<br>    and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
<br>
<br>  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
<br>    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
<br>    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
<br>    Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
<br>    translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
<br>    original work has been modified.";
<br>
<br>  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
<br>    Collections; and,
<br>
<br>  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
<br>
<br>  e. 
<br>
<br>    For the avoidance of doubt:
<br>
<br>      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
<br>        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
<br>        licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
<br>        right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
<br>        granted under this License;
<br>
<br>      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
<br>        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
<br>        licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
<br>        to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
<br>        under this License; and,
<br>
<br>      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
<br>        royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
<br>        member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
<br>        schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
<br>        under this License.
<br>
<br>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
<br>hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
<br>as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
<br>Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
<br>reserved.
<br>
<br>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
<br>to and limited by the following restrictions:
<br>
<br>  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
<br>    License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
<br>    for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
<br>    Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
<br>    terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
<br>    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
<br>    not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
<br>    License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
<br>    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
<br>    Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
<br>    that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
<br>    rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section
<br>    4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
<br>    require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
<br>    terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
<br>    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any
<br>    credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
<br>    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
<br>    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
<br>    4(b), as requested.
<br>
<br>  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
<br>    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
<br>    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
<br>    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
<br>    (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
<br>    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
<br>    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
<br>    Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
<br>    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
<br>    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
<br>    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
<br>    does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
<br>    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
<br>    credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
<br>    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
<br>    Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
<br>    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
<br>    a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
<br>    for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
<br>    part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
<br>    for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
<br>    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
<br>    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
<br>    may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
<br>    sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
<br>    Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
<br>    the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
<br>    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
<br>
<br>  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
<br>    permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
<br>    the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
<br>    must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
<br>    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
<br>    honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.
<br>    Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
<br>    License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
<br>    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
<br>    Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
<br>    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
<br>    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
<br>    under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
<br>    otherwise.
<br>
<br>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
<br>
<br>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
<br>THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
<br>THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
<br>LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br>PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
<br>THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
<br>JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION
<br>MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br>
<br>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
<br>NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
<br>INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
<br>LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br>
<br>7. Termination
<br>
<br>  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
<br>    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
<br>    who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
<br>    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
<br>    entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
<br>    7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
<br>
<br>  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
<br>    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
<br>    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
<br>    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
<br>    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
<br>    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
<br>    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
<br>    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
<br>
<br>8. Miscellaneous
<br>
<br>  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
<br>    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
<br>    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
<br>
<br>  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
<br>    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
<br>    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
<br>
<br>  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
<br>    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
<br>    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
<br>    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
<br>    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br>
<br>  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
<br>    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
<br>    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
<br>
<br>  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
<br>    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
<br>    representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
<br>    not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
<br>    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
<br>    written agreement of the Licensor and You.
<br>
<br>  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
<br>    were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
<br>    Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
<br>    the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
<br>    Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
<br>    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
<br>    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
<br>    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
<br>    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
<br>    the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
<br>    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
<br>    deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
<br>    restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
