<br>END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR ACME SOFTWARE
<br>============================================
<br>
<br>IMPORTANT READ CAREFULLY: This ACME End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a
<br>legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and ACME
<br>Corporation for the ACME software product identified above, which includes
<br>computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, and
<br>"online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT"). The SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>also includes any updates and supplements to the original SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>provided to you by ACME. Any software provided along with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>that is associated with a separate end-user license agreement is licensed to you
<br>under the terms of that license agreement. By installing, copying, downloading,
<br>accessing, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the
<br>terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install
<br>or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; you may, however, return it to your place of
<br>purchase for a full refund.
<br>
<br>
<br>SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright
<br>treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE
<br>PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.
<br>
<br>  1. GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following rights:
<br>
<br>      * Applications Software. You may install, use, access, display, run, or
<br>        otherwise interact with ("RUN") one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, or any
<br>        prior version for the same operating system, on a single computer,
<br>        workstation, terminal, handheld PC, pager, "smart phone," or other
<br>        digital electronic device ("COMPUTER"). The primary user of the COMPUTER
<br>        on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is installed may make a second copy for his
<br>        or her exclusive use on a portable computer.
<br>
<br>      * Reservation of Rights. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by
<br>        ACME.
<br>
<br>  2. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.
<br>
<br>      * Not for Resale Software. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled "Not For
<br>        Resale" or "NFR," then, notwithstanding other sections of this EULA, your
<br>        use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is limited to use for demonstration, test, or
<br>        evaluation purposes and you may not resell, or otherwise transfer for
<br>        value, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
<br>
<br>      * Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly. You
<br>        may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE PRODUCT,
<br>        except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted
<br>        by applicable law.
<br>
<br>      * Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed as a single
<br>        product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than
<br>        one COMPUTER.
<br>
<br>      * Trademarks. This EULA does not grant you any rights in connection with
<br>        any trademarks or service marks of ACME.
<br>
<br>      * Rental. You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
<br>
<br>      * Support Services. ACME may provide you with support services related to
<br>        the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Support Services"). Use of Support Services is
<br>        governed by the ACME policies and programs described in the user manual,
<br>        in "online" documentation, and/or in other ACME-provided materials. Any
<br>        supplemental software code provided to you as part of the Support
<br>        Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to
<br>        the terms and conditions of this EULA.
<br>
<br>      * Software Transfer. The initial licensee of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may make
<br>        a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT only
<br>        directly to an end user. This transfer must include all of the SOFTWARE
<br>        PRODUCT (including all component parts, the media and printed materials,
<br>        any upgrades, this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of
<br>        Authenticity). Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any
<br>        other indirect transfer. The transferee of such one-time transfer must
<br>        agree to comply with the terms of this EULA, including the obligation not
<br>        to further transfer this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
<br>
<br>      * Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, ACME may terminate
<br>        this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this
<br>        EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>        and all of its component parts.
<br>
<br>  3. COPYRIGHT. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>    (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video,
<br>    audio, music, text, and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT),
<br>    the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>    are owned by ACME or its suppliers. All title and intellectual property
<br>    rights in and to the content that may be accessed through use of the SOFTWARE
<br>    PRODUCT is the property of the respective content owner and may be protected
<br>    by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.
<br>    This EULA grants you no rights to use such content. If this SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>    contains documentation that is provided only in electronic form, you may
<br>    print one copy of such electronic documentation. You may not copy the printed
<br>    materials accompanying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
<br>
<br>  4. BACKUP COPY. After installation of one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pursuant
<br>    to this EULA, you may keep the original media on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
<br>    was provided by ACME solely for backup or archival purposes. If the original
<br>    media is required to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on the COMPUTER, you may make
<br>    one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT solely for backup or archival purposes.
<br>    Except as expressly provided in this EULA, you may not otherwise make copies
<br>    of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE
<br>    PRODUCT.
<br>
<br>  5. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S.
<br>    Government pursuant to solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995 is
<br>    provided with the commercial rights and restrictions described elsewhere
<br>    herein. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to
<br>    solicitations issued prior to December 1, 1995 is provided with RESTRICTED
<br>    RIGHTS as provided for in FAR, 48 CFR 52.227-14 (JUNE 1987) or FAR, 48 CFR
<br>    252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), as applicable.
<br>
<br>  6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. This SOFTWARE PRODUCT has been classified by the US
<br>    Government as exportable under License Exception TSU. Therefore the following
<br>    terms apply: You agree that you will not export or re-export the SOFTWARE
<br>    PRODUCT, any part thereof, or any process or service that is the direct
<br>    product of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (the foregoing collectively referred to as
<br>    the Restricted Components), to any country, person or entity subject to U.S.
<br>    export restrictions. You specifically agree not to export or re-export any of
<br>    the Restricted Components (i) to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed
<br>    or restricted the export of goods or services, which currently include, but
<br>    are not necessarily limited to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
<br>    and Syria, or to any national of any such country, wherever located, who
<br>    intends to transmit or transport the Restricted Components back to such
<br>    country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or have reason to know
<br>    will utilize the Restricted Components in the design, development or
<br>    production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any person
<br>    or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export
<br>    transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. You warrant and
<br>    represent that neither the Bureau of Export Administration nor any other U.S.
<br>    federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges.
<br>
<br>
<br>MISCELLANEOUS
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>This EULA is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the
<br>United States of America.
<br>
<br>
<br>LIMITED WARRANTY
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>ACME warrants that (a) the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will perform substantially in
<br>accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90)
<br>days from the date of receipt, and (b) any Support Services provided by ACME
<br>shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to
<br>you by ACME, and ACME support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts
<br>to solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow
<br>limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not
<br>apply to you.
<br>
<br>
<br>CUSTOMER REMEDIES. ACMEs and its suppliersentire liability and your exclusive
<br>remedy shall be, at ACMEs option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or
<br>(b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet ACMEs
<br>Limited Warranty and which is returned to ACME with a copy of your receipt. This
<br>Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from
<br>accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be
<br>warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,
<br>whichever is longer.
<br>
<br>NO OTHER WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACME AND
<br>ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE
<br>SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES.
<br>THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH
<br>VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.
<br> 
<br>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no
<br>event shall ACME or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
<br>indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,
<br>damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
<br>information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability
<br>to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the provision of or failure to provide Support
<br>Services, even if ACME has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In
<br>any case, ACMEs entire liability under any provision of this EULA shall be
<br>limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE
<br>PRODUCT or U.S. $5.00; provided, however, if you have entered into a ACME Support
<br>Services Agreement, ACMEs entire liability regarding Support Services shall be
<br>governed by the terms of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions do
<br>not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not
<br>apply to you.

<br>
<br>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE

<br>TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
<br>CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
<br>
<br>1. Definitions
<br>
<br>  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
<br>    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
<br>    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
<br>    phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
<br>    other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including
<br>    in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
<br>    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
<br>    of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
<br>    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
<br>    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
<br>    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
<br>
<br>  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
<br>    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
<br>    other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
<br>    which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
<br>    constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
<br>    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
<br>    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
<br>    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
<br>    not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
<br>    License.
<br>

<br>    Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise

<br>
<br>  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to

<br>
<br>2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or
<br>restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
<br>exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
<br>under copyright law or other applicable laws.
<br>
<br>3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
<br>hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
<br>duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
<br>as stated below:
<br>
<br>  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
<br>    and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
<br>
<br>  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
<br>    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
<br>    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
<br>    Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
<br>    translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
<br>    original work has been modified.";
<br>
<br>  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
<br>    Collections; and,
<br>
<br>  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
<br>
<br>  e. 
<br>
<br>    For the avoidance of doubt:
<br>
<br>      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
<br>        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
<br>        licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
<br>        right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
<br>        granted under this License;
<br>
<br>      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
<br>        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
<br>        licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
<br>        to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
<br>        under this License; and,
<br>
<br>      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
<br>        royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
<br>        member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
<br>        schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
<br>        under this License.
<br>
<br>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
<br>hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
<br>as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
<br>Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
<br>reserved.
<br>
<br>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
<br>to and limited by the following restrictions:
<br>
<br>  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
<br>    License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
<br>    for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
<br>    Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
<br>    terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
<br>    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
<br>    not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
<br>    License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
<br>    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
<br>    Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
<br>    that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
<br>    rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section
<br>    4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
<br>    require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
<br>    terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
<br>    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any
<br>    credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
<br>    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
<br>    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
<br>    4(b), as requested.
<br>
<br>  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
<br>    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
<br>    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
<br>    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
<br>    (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
<br>    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
<br>    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
<br>    Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
<br>    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
<br>    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
<br>    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
<br>    does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
<br>    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
<br>    credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
<br>    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
<br>    Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
<br>    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
<br>    a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
<br>    for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
<br>    part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
<br>    for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
<br>    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
<br>    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
<br>    may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
<br>    sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
<br>    Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
<br>    the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
<br>    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
<br>
<br>  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
<br>    permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
<br>    the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
<br>    must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
<br>    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
<br>    honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.
<br>    Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
<br>    License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
<br>    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
<br>    Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
<br>    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
<br>    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
<br>    under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
<br>    otherwise.
<br>
<br>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
<br>
<br>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
<br>THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
<br>THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
<br>LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br>PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
<br>THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
<br>JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION
<br>MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br>
<br>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
<br>NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
<br>INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
<br>LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br>
<br>7. Termination
<br>
<br>  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
<br>    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
<br>    who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
<br>    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
<br>    entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
<br>    7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
<br>
<br>  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
<br>    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
<br>    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
<br>    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
<br>    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
<br>    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
<br>    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
<br>    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
<br>
<br>8. Miscellaneous
<br>
<br>  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
<br>    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
<br>    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
<br>
<br>  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
<br>    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
<br>    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
<br>
<br>  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
<br>    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
<br>    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
<br>    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
<br>    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br>
<br>  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
<br>    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
<br>    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
<br>
<br>  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
<br>    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
<br>    representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
<br>    not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
<br>    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
<br>    written agreement of the Licensor and You.
<br>
<br>  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
<br>    were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
<br>    Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
<br>    the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
<br>    Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
<br>    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
<br>    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
<br>    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
<br>    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
<br>    the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
<br>    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
<br>    deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
<br>    restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
<br>
<br>
<br>  Creative Commons Notice
<br>
<br>  Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
<br>  whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable
<br>  to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including
<br>  without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
<br>  arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)
<br>  sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the
<br>  Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
<br>
<br>  Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is

<br>  either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or

<br>  of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of this License.

<br>Creative Commons Legal Code
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>CC0 1.0 Universal
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
<br>SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
<br>RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
<br>CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
<br>INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
<br>RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
<br>HEREUNDER.
<br>
<br>
<br>Statement of Purpose
<br>
<br>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
<br>exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
<br>subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
<br>and/or a database (each, a "Work").
<br>
<br>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
<br>purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
<br>("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
<br>infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
<br>redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
<br>including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
<br>the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
<br>creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
<br>distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
<br>
<br>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
<br>additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
<br>(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
<br>Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
<br>publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
<br>Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
<br>effect of CC0 on those rights.
<br>
<br>1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
<br>by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
<br>Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
<br>
<br>  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
<br>    and translate a Work;
<br>
<br>  ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
<br>
<br>  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
<br>    depicted in a Work;
<br>
<br>  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
<br>    to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
<br>
<br>  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
<br>    Work;
<br>
<br>  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
<br>    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
<br>    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
<br>    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
<br>
<br>  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
<br>    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
<br>
<br>2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
<br>applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
<br>unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
<br>Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
<br>unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
<br>the Work
<br>
<br>  i.  in all territories worldwide,
<br>
<br>  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
<br>    future time extensions),
<br>
<br>  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and
<br>
<br>  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
<br>    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").
<br>
<br>Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
<br>and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
<br>such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
<br>termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
<br>enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
<br>Statement of Purpose.
<br>
<br>3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
<br>judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall
<br>be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
<br>express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
<br>Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,
<br>non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
<br>exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
<br>
<br>  i.  in all territories worldwide,
<br>
<br>  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
<br>    future time extensions),
<br>
<br>  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and
<br>
<br>  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
<br>    advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").
<br>
<br>The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer
<br>to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
<br>invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
<br>ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such
<br>case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not
<br>
<br>  i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
<br>    Work or
<br>
<br>  ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
<br>    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
<br>
<br>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
<br>
<br>  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
<br>    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
<br>
<br>  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of
<br>    any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
<br>    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
<br>    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
<br>    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
<br>    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
<br>
<br>  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
<br>    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
<br>    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
<br>    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
<br>    other rights required for any use of the Work.
<br>
<br>  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party
<br>    to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or
<br>    use of the Work.

<br>
<br>
<br>Preamble
<br>--------
<br>
<br>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
<br>and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
<br>guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
<br>software is free for all its users.
<br>
<br>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
<br>designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
<br>Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
<br>suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
<br>General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
<br>based on the explanations below.
<br>
<br>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
<br>Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
<br>to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
<br>that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
<br>the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
<br>that you can do these things.
<br>
<br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
<br>deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions
<br>translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
<br>library or if you modify it.
<br>
<br>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
<br>fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
<br>sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
<br>with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
<br>that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
<br>and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br>
<br>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
<br>(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br>distribute and/or modify the library.
<br>
<br>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
<br>warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
<br>and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original
<br>version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by
<br>problems that might be introduced by others.
<br>
<br>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
<br>program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
<br>users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
<br>Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
<br>library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
<br>license.
<br>
<br>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
<br>General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
<br>applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
<br>General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to
<br>permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
<br>
<br>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
<br>library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
<br>derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore
<br>permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
<br>The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other
<br>code with the library.
<br>
<br>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
<br>protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
<br>provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
<br>non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
<br>Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
<br>advantages in certain special circumstances.
<br>
<br>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
<br>widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.
<br>To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more
<br>frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
<br>libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to
<br>free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br>
<br>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
<br>enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
<br>example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
<br>more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
<br>GNU/Linux operating system.
<br>
<br>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
<br>freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
<br>Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
<br>version of the Library.
<br>
<br>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
<br>follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
<br>library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
<br>from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
<br>to run.
<br>
<br>
<br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br>
<br>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
<br>contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
<br>it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
<br>called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br>
<br>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
<br>to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
<br>functions and data) to form executables.
<br>
<br>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
<br>distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
<br>Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
<br>containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
<br>and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
<br>translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br>
<br>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
<br>modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
<br>code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
<br>plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
<br>
<br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
<br>this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
<br>Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
<br>contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
<br>Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
<br>Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br>
<br>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
<br>code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
<br>of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
<br>absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br>Library.
<br>
<br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
<br>your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br>
<br>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
<br>forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
<br>or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
<br>these conditions:
<br>
<br>      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br>
<br>      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
<br>      that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br>
<br>      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
<br>      third parties under the terms of this License.
<br>
<br>      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
<br>      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
<br>      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
<br>      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
<br>      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
<br>      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
<br>
<br>      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
<br>      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
<br>      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
<br>      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
<br>      the square root function must still compute square roots.)
<br>
<br>      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
<br>      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
<br>      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
<br>      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
<br>      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
<br>      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
<br>      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
<br>      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
<br>      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br>
<br>      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
<br>      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
<br>      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
<br>      based on the Library.
<br>
<br>      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
<br>      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
<br>      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
<br>      this License.
<br>
<br>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
<br>instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
<br>alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
<br>ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
<br>newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
<br>appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any
<br>other change in these notices.
<br>
<br>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
<br>the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
<br>derivative works made from that copy.
<br>
<br>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
<br>a program that is not a library.
<br>
<br>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
<br>and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
<br>machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
<br>Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br>
<br>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
<br>designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
<br>the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
<br>though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
<br>code.
<br>
<br>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
<br>designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
<br>a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
<br>work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br>
<br>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
<br>executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
<br>the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
<br>therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
<br>such executables.
<br>
<br>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part
<br>of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the
<br>Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
<br>significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
<br>itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
<br>law.
<br>
<br>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
<br>accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
<br>length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
<br>it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
<br>portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br>
<br>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
<br>object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing
<br>that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with
<br>the Library itself.
<br>
<br>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
<br>that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
<br>the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
<br>the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br>engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br>
<br>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
<br>used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must
<br>supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
<br>notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
<br>well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
<br>must do one of these things:
<br>
<br>      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br>      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
<br>      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
<br>      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
<br>      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source
<br>      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
<br>      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
<br>      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
<br>      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
<br>      definitions.)
<br>
<br>      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
<br>      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
<br>      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
<br>      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
<br>      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
<br>      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
<br>      made with.
<br>
<br>      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
<br>      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for
<br>      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br>
<br>      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
<br>      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
<br>      materials from the same place.
<br>
<br>      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
<br>      that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br>
<br>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
<br>include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
<br>it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
<br>include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
<br>with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
<br>on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br>executable.
<br>
<br>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
<br>proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
<br>contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
<br>executable that you distribute.
<br>
<br>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
<br>side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
<br>covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
<br>the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
<br>library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
<br>things:
<br>
<br>      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
<br>      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
<br>      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
<br>
<br>      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
<br>      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
<br>      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br>
<br>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
<br>except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
<br>modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
<br>automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
<br>received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
<br>licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br>
<br>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
<br>However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
<br>or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
<br>this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
<br>based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library
<br>or works based on it.
<br>
<br>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
<br>the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
<br>copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
<br>conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
<br>exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
<br>compliance by third parties with this License.
<br>
<br>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
<br>or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
<br>you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
<br>conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
<br>License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
<br>obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
<br>consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
<br>who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br>could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br>distribution of the Library.
<br>
<br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the
<br>section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br>
<br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
<br>other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
<br>section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
<br>distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
<br>have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
<br>up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
<br>through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br>
<br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
<br>consequence of the rest of this License.
<br>
<br>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
<br>countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
<br>holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical
<br>distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
<br>permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
<br>License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br>
<br>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
<br>Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
<br>similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
<br>problems or concerns.
<br>
<br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a
<br>version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
<br>have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
<br>of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
<br>does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
<br>published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br>
<br>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
<br>whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to
<br>ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
<br>Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
<br>for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
<br>status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
<br>reuse of software generally.
<br>
<br>NO WARRANTY
<br>
<br>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
<br>LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
<br>IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"
<br>WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
<br>LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
<br>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br>
<br>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
<br>ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
<br>LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
<br>SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
<br>TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br>THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
<br>PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br>
<br>
<br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br>
<br>
<br>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br>----------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
<br>to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
<br>redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
<br>terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
<br>License).
<br>
<br>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
<br>exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
<br>and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br>
<br>      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
<br>
<br>      Copyright (C) year name of author
<br>
<br>      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br>
<br>      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br>
<br>      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br>
<br>      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br>
<br>      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br>
<br>      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br>
<br>      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br>
<br>      Lesser General Public License for more details.
<br>
<br>      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br>
<br>      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br>
<br>      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br>
<br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br>
<br>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
<br>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a
<br>sample; alter the names:
<br>
<br>      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
<br>
<br>      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

<br>

<br>
<br>      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>
<br>      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>      [This is the first released version of the Library GPL. It is numbered 2
<br>      because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
<br>
<br>
<br>Preamble
<br>--------
<br>
<br>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
<br>and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
<br>guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
<br>software is free for all its users.
<br>
<br>This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
<br>designated Free Software Foundation software, and to other libraries whose
<br>authors who decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries too.
<br>
<br>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
<br>General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
<br>distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
<br>that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
<br>the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
<br>do these things.
<br>
<br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
<br>you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
<br>translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
<br>library, or if you modify it.
<br>
<br>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
<br>fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
<br>sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program
<br>with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so
<br>that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
<br>and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br>
<br>Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,
<br>and (2) offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br>distribute and/or modify the library.
<br>
<br>Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone
<br>understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is
<br>modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
<br>they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others
<br>will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
<br>
<br>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
<br>to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually
<br>obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary
<br>software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed
<br>for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br>
<br>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
<br>General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,
<br>the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.
<br>This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in
<br>full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary
<br>license.
<br>
<br>The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur
<br>the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and
<br>simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library,
<br>is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility
<br>program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked
<br>executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the
<br>ordinary General Public License treats it as such.
<br>
<br>Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License
<br>for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most
<br>developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might
<br>promote sharing better.
<br>
<br>However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of
<br>those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.
<br>This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free
<br>programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such
<br>programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not
<br>seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved
<br>it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that
<br>this will lead to faster development of free libraries.
<br>
<br>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
<br>follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
<br>library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
<br>from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.
<br>
<br>Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General
<br>Public License rather than by this special one.
<br>
<br>
<br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br>
<br>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice
<br>placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be
<br>distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called
<br>"this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br>
<br>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
<br>to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
<br>functions and data) to form executables.
<br>
<br>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
<br>distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
<br>Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
<br>containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
<br>and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
<br>translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br>
<br>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
<br>modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
<br>code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
<br>plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
<br>
<br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
<br>this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
<br>Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
<br>contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
<br>Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
<br>Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br>
<br>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
<br>code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
<br>of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
<br>absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br>Library.
<br>
<br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
<br>your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br>
<br>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
<br>forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
<br>or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
<br>these conditions:
<br>
<br>      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br>
<br>      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
<br>      that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br>
<br>      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
<br>      third parties under the terms of this License.
<br>
<br>      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
<br>      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
<br>      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
<br>      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
<br>      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
<br>      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
<br>
<br>      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
<br>      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
<br>      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
<br>      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
<br>      the square root function must still compute square roots.)
<br>
<br>      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
<br>      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
<br>      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
<br>      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
<br>      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
<br>      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
<br>      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
<br>      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
<br>      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br>
<br>      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
<br>      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
<br>      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
<br>      based on the Library.
<br>
<br>      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
<br>      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
<br>      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
<br>      this License.
<br>
<br>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
<br>instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
<br>alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
<br>ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
<br>newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
<br>appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any
<br>other change in these notices.
<br>
<br>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
<br>the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
<br>derivative works made from that copy.
<br>
<br>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
<br>a program that is not a library.
<br>
<br>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
<br>and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
<br>machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
<br>Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br>
<br>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
<br>designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
<br>the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
<br>though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
<br>code.
<br>
<br>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
<br>designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
<br>a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
<br>work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br>
<br>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
<br>executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
<br>the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
<br>therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
<br>such executables.
<br>
<br>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part
<br>of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the
<br>Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
<br>significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
<br>itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
<br>law.
<br>
<br>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
<br>accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
<br>length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
<br>it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
<br>portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br>
<br>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
<br>object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing
<br>that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with
<br>the Library itself.
<br>
<br>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work
<br>that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
<br>the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
<br>the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br>engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br>
<br>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
<br>used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must
<br>supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
<br>notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
<br>well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
<br>must do one of these things:
<br>
<br>      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br>      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
<br>      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
<br>      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
<br>      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source
<br>      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
<br>      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
<br>      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
<br>      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
<br>      definitions.)
<br>
<br>      b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
<br>      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for
<br>      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br>
<br>      c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
<br>      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
<br>      materials from the same place.
<br>
<br>      d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
<br>      that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br>
<br>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
<br>include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
<br>it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
<br>major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which
<br>the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
<br>
<br>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
<br>proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
<br>contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
<br>executable that you distribute.
<br>
<br>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
<br>side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
<br>covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
<br>the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
<br>library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
<br>things:
<br>
<br>      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
<br>      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
<br>      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
<br>
<br>      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
<br>      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
<br>      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br>
<br>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
<br>except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
<br>modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
<br>automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
<br>received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
<br>licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br>
<br>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
<br>However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
<br>or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
<br>this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
<br>based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library
<br>or works based on it.
<br>
<br>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
<br>the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
<br>copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
<br>conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
<br>exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
<br>compliance by third parties to this License.
<br>
<br>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
<br>or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
<br>you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
<br>conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
<br>License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
<br>obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
<br>consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
<br>who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br>could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br>distribution of the Library.
<br>
<br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the
<br>section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br>
<br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
<br>other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
<br>section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
<br>distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
<br>have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
<br>up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
<br>through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br>
<br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
<br>consequence of the rest of this License.
<br>
<br>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
<br>countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
<br>holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical
<br>distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
<br>permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
<br>License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br>
<br>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
<br>Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
<br>similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
<br>problems or concerns.
<br>
<br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a
<br>version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
<br>have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
<br>of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
<br>does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
<br>published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br>
<br>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
<br>whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to
<br>ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
<br>Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
<br>for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
<br>status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
<br>reuse of software generally.
<br>
<br>NO WARRANTY
<br>
<br>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
<br>LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
<br>IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"
<br>WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
<br>LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
<br>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br>
<br>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
<br>ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
<br>LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
<br>SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
<br>TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br>THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
<br>PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br>
<br>
<br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br>
<br>
<br>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br>----------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
<br>to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
<br>redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
<br>terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
<br>License).
<br>
<br>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
<br>exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
<br>and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br>
<br>      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
<br>
<br>      Copyright (C) year name of author
<br>
<br>      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br>
<br>      modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
<br>
<br>      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br>
<br>      version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br>
<br>      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br>
<br>      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br>
<br>      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br>
<br>      Library General Public License for more details.
<br>
<br>      You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
<br>
<br>      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br>
<br>      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
<br>
<br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br>
<br>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
<br>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a
<br>sample; alter the names:
<br>
<br>      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
<br>
<br>      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written
<br>
<br>      by James Random Hacker.
<br>
